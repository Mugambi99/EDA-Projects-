## TOUR DE FRANCE
>The project aims to analyze the performance of cyclists in the Tour de France race using publicly available data. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python and analyzing it using various statistical techniques, such as correlation analysis and visualization.

>The results of the analysis suggest that certain factors, such as the number of stages won and the number of kilometers raced, have a significant impact on a cyclist's success in the Tour de France. The project also provides insights into the performance of individual cyclists, such as Egan Bernal and Tadej Pogacar, and compares their performance to the overall race average.

>Overall, the Tour de France project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to gain insights into sports performance and inform strategic decision-making. The use of Python programming and statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and data visualization demonstrate the potential for data-driven insights to inform sports analytics and improve athletic performance.
