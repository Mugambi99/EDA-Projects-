## FOOD CARBON FOOTPRINT
>The project aims to analyze the carbon footprint of different food products and identify ways to reduce their environmental impact. The data for the analysis was sourced from the publicly available website, Our World in Data.

>The methodology used in the analysis involved cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python and analyzing it using various statistical techniques and visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots, to identify patterns and relationships between different variables. The results of the analysis indicate that certain foods, such as beef and lamb, have a significantly higher carbon footprint than other foods, such as vegetables and grains.

>The project also provides insights into ways to reduce the carbon footprint of different foods, such as by reducing food waste and choosing plant-based options. Overall, the Food Carbon Footprint project provides a valuable demonstration of how data analysis can be used to gain insights into environmental sustainability and inform personal and policy decisions around food consumption. The use of Python programming and statistical techniques such as data visualization demonstrate the potential for data-driven insights to inform sustainable food systems and reduce their environmental impact.

## TOUR DE FRANCE
>The project aims to analyze the performance of cyclists in the Tour de France race using publicly available data. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python and analyzing it using various statistical techniques, such as correlation analysis and visualization.

>The results of the analysis suggest that certain factors, such as the number of stages won and the number of kilometers raced, have a significant impact on a cyclist's success in the Tour de France. The project also provides insights into the performance of individual cyclists, such as Egan Bernal and Tadej Pogacar, and compares their performance to the overall race average.

>Overall, the Tour de France project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to gain insights into sports performance and inform strategic decision-making. The use of Python programming and statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and data visualization demonstrate the potential for data-driven insights to inform sports analytics and improve athletic performance.
