# FOOD CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Climate change is at the center of boardroom discussions, on how the increased 
talk and regulation will impact businesses and how they can capitalize on this to 
be sustainable in the future and not treat it as an obstacle to growth. At an individual 
level we also share in the responsibility of making the right decisions that care for 
the future generations. The most effective way of doing this is to stay informed on what 
the major contributors to this 21st century menace is, and thereby make informed choices 
and shape policy. 

**We are going to be tackling the following questions;**
- The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa.
- Highlight the marked difference between consumption and emissions in certain food product of your choice
- The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon footprint. 
- Beef's contribution to CO2 emissions (kg/person/year) 
- A box plot and interpretation of the CO2 contributions of food levels.
- Top 10 Countries with highest emissions. Choose the appropriate visual type. 
- Using the data to write a 500 words minimum of insights and the story behind the exploration.
- Alternatively compile a set of slides with your insights.
