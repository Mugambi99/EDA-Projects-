# FOOD CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Climate change is at the center of boardroom discussions, on how the increased 
talk and regulation will impact businesses and how they can capitalize on this to 
be sustainable in the future and not treat it as an obstacle to growth. At an individual 
level we also share in the responsibility of making the right decisions that care for 
the future generations. The most effective way of doing this is to stay informed on what 
the major contributors to this 21st century menace is, and thereby make informed choices 
and shape policy. 

## What creates a food's carbon footprint?
- Production – the fertilisers, pesticides, animal feed, water and other materials (like electricity) used to grow or raise food
- Processing – harvesting crops and dispatching animals, or the energy used in creating secondary foods such as dairy products
- Transportation – this includes from farms to processing plants, then on to retail units and finally from the shops to your home
- Storage and cooking – the electricity involved in refrigerating and then cooking the food you’ve bought
- Waste – this is both the food you throw away and unsold food disposed of by retailers

**We are going to be tackling the following questions;**
- The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa.
- Highlight the marked difference between consumption and emissions in certain food product of your choice
- The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon footprint. 
- Beef's contribution to CO2 emissions (kg/person/year) 
- A box plot and interpretation of the CO2 contributions of food levels.
- Top 10 Countries with highest emissions.  

**The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa.**

>The report indicates that Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda accounted for a large propotion of Co2 emissions in East Africa.
Kenya having the largest metric of emission and the least being Rwanda
It important to note that Ethiopia and Rwanda over the recent years has a faster growth rates recorded than other countries in East Africa.
Kenya is a more industrialised country majoring in the top four emmitters namely transport, electricity, constrution and non metal manufacturing hence having high Co2 emissions

**The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon footprint.**

>There is no doubt that animal products eg. meat – beef in particular – makes an unsurpassable contribution to the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions. It also devours more land and water and causes more environmental damage than any other single food product.

>Animal products have an outstanding large effect of Co2 emmission all over the world becauseWhen we consume animal-based products, we are essentially consuming the energy that the animal has consumed. This means that a large amount of energy is lost during the conversion process, resulting in a high carbon footprint. It takes a lot more energy and resources to produce animal-based products than plant-based products.

>For example, animal agriculture requires a lot of land, water, and feed. In addition, animals produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, during digestion, which contributes to the carbon footprint of animal agriculture. Transportation and processing of animal products also contribute to their high carbon footprint.

>In contrast, plant-based foods require less land, water, and resources to produce, and have a lower carbon footprint. This is why a plant-based diet is considered more environmentally sustainable than a diet that includes a lot of animal products.

**A box plot and interpretation of the CO2 contributions of food levels.**
>Box plots are useful tools for visualizing the distribution of a dataset and identifying outliers. They provide information about the range of the data, the median, and the quartiles.
>From our data the outliers has an effect on the mean because it takes into account the value of each observation in the dataset. The standard deviation is also sensitive to outliers because it measures the variability of the data around the mean. As a result, outliers can skew the mean and increase the standard deviation.

**Top 10 Countries with highest emissions**

 >Argentina is one of the largest producers of beef and soybeans in the world. The production of these commodities requires large amounts of land, water, and energy, which can result in significant greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2 emissions.
 >From the data below we see that Argentina is the top country having Co2 emission in regards to food carbon footprint. Their are other factors such as transportation and industrial processes that largely contribute to Co2 emission

**Conclusion**
>Climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action to mitigate its effects. The longer we delay taking action to reduce carbon emissions, the more difficult it will become to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. It is important to act quickly and decisively to reduce our carbon footprint and protect the planet
>We can achieve this by;
> - Reduce Food Waste: Food waste generates significant carbon emissions. By reducing food waste, we can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our food. This can be done by planning meals carefully, storing food correctly, and using leftovers effectively.

> - Choose Sustainable Foods: Some foods have a lower carbon footprint than others. By choosing foods that have been produced sustainably, such as locally sourced produce, organic products, and plant-based options, we can reduce the carbon footprint of our food.

> - Reduce Meat Consumption: Meat production generates significant carbon emissions. By reducing meat consumption, we can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our food. This can be done by consuming smaller portions of meat, choosing leaner cuts of meat, and replacing meat with plant-based alternatives
