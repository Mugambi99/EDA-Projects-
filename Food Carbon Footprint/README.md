# FOOD CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Climate change is at the center of boardroom discussions, on how the increased 
talk and regulation will impact businesses and how they can capitalize on this to 
be sustainable in the future and not treat it as an obstacle to growth. At an individual 
level we also share in the responsibility of making the right decisions that care for 
the future generations. The most effective way of doing this is to stay informed on what 
the major contributors to this 21st century menace is, and thereby make informed choices 
and shape policy. 

## What creates a food's carbon footprint?
- Production – the fertilisers, pesticides, animal feed, water and other materials (like electricity) used to grow or raise food

- Processing – harvesting crops and dispatching animals, or the energy used in creating secondary foods such as dairy products

- Transportation – this includes from farms to processing plants, then on to retail units and finally from the shops to your home

- Storage and cooking – the electricity involved in refrigerating and then cooking the food you’ve bought

- Waste – this is both the food you throw away and unsold food disposed of by retailers

**We are going to be tackling the following questions;**
- The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa.
- Highlight the marked difference between consumption and emissions in certain food product of your choice
- The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon footprint. 
- Beef's contribution to CO2 emissions (kg/person/year) 
- A box plot and interpretation of the CO2 contributions of food levels.
- Top 10 Countries with highest emissions. Choose the appropriate visual type. 
- Using the data to write a 500 words minimum of insights and the story behind the exploration.
- Alternatively compile a set of slides with your insights.

**The average C02 emission per person by food category among five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia) located in East Africa.**

The report indicates that Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda accounted for a large propotion of Co2 emissions in East Africa.
Kenya having the largest metric of emission and the least being Rwanda
It important to note that Ethiopia and Rwanda over the recent years has a faster growth rates recorded than other countries in East Africa.
Kenya is a more industrialised country majoring in the top four emmitters namely transport, electricity, constrution and non metal manufacturing hence having high Co2 emissions

**The food consumption of animal and non-animal products and the impact on carbon footprint.**

There is no doubt that animal products eg. meat – beef in particular – makes an unsurpassable contribution to the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions. It also devours more land and water and causes more environmental damage than any other single food product.
