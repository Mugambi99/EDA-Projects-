Tour de France is an annual multi-stage bicycle race held primarily in France, but also occasionally venturing into neighboring countries. The competition typically spans three weeks and covers over 2,000 miles, with stages that vary in terrain and distance. The race is divided into daily stages, with riders competing against the clock and each other, and accumulating time penalties or bonuses for their performances.

The race was first held in 1903 and has since become one of the most prestigious events in the sport of cycling. It attracts top professional cyclists from around the world and is watched by millions of fans worldwide. The race route changes every year, with the course often including mountainous terrain and challenging climbs, such as the famous ascent up the Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps.

The Tour de France is organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) and is typically broadcast live on television and online. The race has a rich history and is known for its traditions and customs, such as the yellow jersey worn by the race leader, the polka dot jersey for the best climber, and the green jersey for the best sprinter. The race also features a team competition and awards various other prizes for performance in specific stages or categories.

##  What's the tournament all about ?

The Tour de France is a cycling race that takes place over the course of 21 stages, with each stage taking place on a different day. The race usually takes place over a period of three weeks, typically in July.

The route of the Tour de France changes every year, but the race typically covers a distance of around 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) across different types of terrain, including flat stages, mountain stages, and time trials.

Each stage of the race has a different format and challenges for the riders. For example, flat stages are typically shorter and allow sprinters to compete for the stage win, while mountain stages are longer and more difficult, with steep climbs and descents that test the endurance and skill of the riders.

At the end of each stage, the rider with the fastest time is declared the stage winner and is awarded a prize. The rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the race is declared the overall winner of the Tour de France and is awarded the prestigious yellow jersey.

In addition to the individual competition, there are also team competitions, including the team time trial and the team classification, which are based on the combined performance of the team's riders.

Overall, the Tour de France is a grueling and challenging race that requires a combination of physical strength, endurance, and strategic planning to win.

## Task at Hand

Exploring the following questions revolving this prestigious tournament: 
- The winning time and how far the runner up is, i.e. how long did it take to win, with every edition. So in a sense 
checking, are there cyclist getting better bikes, or are they getting lazier
- A box plot of the winners per stage type and comment sth. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVffsa7XQAEpMEl?format=png&name=900x900) as inspiration 
- What relationship is there between a winners age and the number of stages led. 
- Sort by the most recent winning and find the winner's nationality and display the top. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVmLOCwWAAUhHL8?format=png&name=900x900) as inspiration

**The winning time and how far the runner up is, i.e. how long did it take to win, with every edition. So in a sense 
checking, are there cyclist getting better bikes, or are they getting lazier**

>Overall, an analysis of historical Tour de France data indicates the average winning time has decreased over time, and what factors might be driving any changes.
One way to do this would be to analyze the winning times of each race winner over time, and calculate the average winning time for each year or decade. This would allow us to see if there has been a trend towards faster winning times over time.
Factors that could contribute to a decrease in winning times over time might include improvements in bike technology, training methods, and nutrition, as well as changes in race rules or strategies. Conversely, factors that could contribute to an increase in winning times might include changes in race route, weather conditions, or the number and quality of competitors.

Here are some of the great technologies used in Tour de France:

- Power meters: Power meters are small devices that attach to a cyclist's bike and measure the amount of power they generate while cycling. This data can be used to optimize training and race strategies.

- Carbon fiber bikes: Carbon fiber bikes are lightweight and incredibly strong, making them the go-to choice for professional cyclists. These bikes are designed to be aerodynamic, which is important for reducing wind resistance and increasing speed.

- Electronic shifting: Electronic shifting allows cyclists to change gears quickly and easily using small buttons mounted on the handlebars. This technology has replaced traditional shift levers and cables, making it easier for riders to shift gears while racing.

- Wind tunnel testing: Wind tunnel testing allows teams to optimize the aerodynamics of their equipment and race strategies. By analyzing wind resistance and turbulence, teams can make small adjustments to their equipment and positions on the bike to increase speed and reduce drag.

- GPS tracking: GPS tracking allows fans to follow the progress of the race in real-time, with live updates on the location and speed of riders. This technology also allows teams to analyze race data and track the progress of their riders.

- Data analytics: Data analytics allows teams to analyze race data and optimize training and race strategies. By collecting and analyzing data on rider performance, teams can make small adjustments to their equipment and training programs to maximize their chances of success.

**What relationship is there between a winners age and the number of stages led.**

>It is evident that young people have a certan cutting edge when it comes to the tournament because they have advantages such as greater stamina and recovery ability, experience and strategic decision-making are also key factors in winning the race.
That being said, it is worth noting that younger riders have historically performed well in the Tour de France. Many past winners, such as Egan Bernal, Chris Froome, and Alberto Contador, won the race in their 20s. However, there have also been several winners who were older, such as Cadel Evans who won at age 34 and Chris Horner who won at age 41.

**Sort by the most recent winning and find the winner's nationality and display the top.**
>France has a strong tradition in road cycling and has produced many successful professional cyclists throughout history. This, coupled with the fact that the Tour de France is the most prestigious and well-known cycling race in the world, has led to French riders winning the race numerous times.

>In fact, France has won the Tour de France more times than any other country, with a total of 36 victories by French riders. Some of the most famous French winners include Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, and Laurent Fignon.

>However, it's worth noting that the Tour de France is a highly competitive race and winning requires a combination of skill, strategy, teamwork, and luck. Riders from other countries have also had great success in the race, including cyclists from Belgium, Spain, Italy, and the United States, among others. In recent years, the race has become more international, with winners from countries such as Great Britain, Colombia, and Slovenia, indicating that success in the Tour de France is not limited to any one country or nationality.
